# Iterators
In Python, an iterator is an object containing a countable number of elements and which implements the iterator protocols. The iterator protocols consist of \_\_iter\_\_() and \_\_next\_\_() methods. The \_\_iter\_\_() method initializes the iterator and returns an iterator object. The \_\_next\_\_() method is used for iteration and it returns the next item in the iterable.\
An iterator always remembers its current state during iteration so that it can step forward the next value of the iterable. Iterable objects are lists, tuples, strings, dictionnaries and sets.\
**Example 1** \
```python
#return an iterator from a dictionnary and print some values
mydico = {"1":"Hello", "2":[1, 4, "foo"], "3":(6,8,3,)}
myiter = iter(mydico.values())
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
```
**Notice**
From the example, we can see that the \_\_next\_\_() method would continue as long as it is called. To avoid that, one can define a condition or uses the StopIteration statement to stop the iteration once all items are reached.\
**Example 2**\
```python
# An example using class object
class Interval:
  def __init__(self, lowest, highest):
    self.current = lowest - 1
    self.highest = highest
  def __iter__(self):
    return self
  def __next__(self):
    self.current += 1
    if self.current < self.highest:
      return self.current
    raise StopIteration
  for a in Interval(23, 30):
    print(a)

```

**Example 3**
```python
# Stop iteration when the last element is reached.
mystring = "foobarbaz"
myiter = iter(mystring)
while True:
  try:
    item = next(myiter)
    print(item)
  except StopIteration:
    break
```
